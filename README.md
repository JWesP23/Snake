# Snake Game using turtle
Python practice - The classic game of snake

A classic Snake game built using Python's `turtle` graphics library. Control the snake to eat food, grow in length, and avoid colliding with walls or yourself.

## Features

- Randomly spawning food
- Score tracking with automatic resets on collision
- Snake body growth with each food eaten
- Modular design with custom `snake`, `food`, and `scoreboard` classes

## Controls

- Move the snake:
  - `W` or `Up Arrow` – move up
  - `S` or `Down Arrow` – move down
  - `A` or `Left Arrow` – move left
  - `D` or `Right Arrow` – move right

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- No external dependencies (only uses the standard library)
